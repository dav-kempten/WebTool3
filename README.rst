WebTool3
========

This is a Django_ based web application, supporting the full time employees and volunteers staff
of the DAV (German Alpine Club) section Allg√§u Kempten in their work with
any number of tours, instructions, talks and other events.

The ``docs/source`` directory contains the plaintext version of
these manuals. If you have Sphinx_ installed, you can build them by typing
``cd docs; make html`` for local browsing.

The official documentation is hosted on https://webtool2.readthedocs.io/de/latest/

The project language is german, and so all other documents are written in german language.
